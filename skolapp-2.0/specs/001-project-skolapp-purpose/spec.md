# Feature Specification: Project Skolapp Purpose

**Feature Branch**: `001-project-skolapp-purpose`  
**Created**: 2025-09-16  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Project: Skolapp Purpose: A single codebase delivering a secure, accessible, performant, and visually appealing learning app with optional AI assistance. It must install as a PWA on iOS/Android and run fully in modern desktop browsers. Core Principles: - Cross-platform first: one responsive codebase, mobile+desktop, offline degraded mode. - PWA baseline: HTTPS, manifest, service worker with install/offline shell. - Accessibility: WCAG 2.1 AA intent, keyboard/focus, ≥4.5:1 contrast. - Security & privacy: least privilege, typed API client, CSP strict, no PII stored locally. - Simplicity: stable patterns, small vertical slices, measurable performance budgets. - AI: optional, transparent, anonymized, never blocks core flows. - Identity & roles: Teacher (auth, MFA/SSO), Student (pseudonymous join); RBAC enforced. - GDPR-first: EU residency, encryption, RoPA/DPIA, DPAs/SCCs, user rights flows. - Community: optional quiz/template sharing with license metadata and moderation. Platform & Architecture: - Frontend: TypeScript + React (or Svelte), CSS variables/themes, API via JSON/HTTPS. - AI integration via controlled API layer, anonymization, clear labeling. - Integrations: Swedish school systems (OIDC/SAML, Skolfederation). - Payments: Stripe (web), RevenueCat/App Store/Play (mobile), clear cancellation. - Performance: TTI ≤5s, initial JS <200KB gzip, LCP <2.5s. - Offline: cached last-known data with fallback. - Error handling: actionable errors + retry. - Telemetry: anonymous perf/error only, opt-out compliant. Workflow & Quality Gates: - Branching: main always deployable; features via PR review. - PR checks: lint, type-check, ≥80% tests on critical modules, Lighthouse ≥90 PWA/a11y, bundle diff <+10%. - GDPR/Security checks: residency verified, DPA/SCC validated, RBAC tests, privacy UI flows, TLS/CSP enforced, no high/critical deps. - Commits: Conventional Commits. - Testing: unit, integration, E2E smoke (install, login, offline). - Release: SemVer, changelog, rollback to N−1 build. Governance: - Waivers: dated, expiring. - Amendments: PR labeled constitution-change, 2 approvals (perf/a11y + security). - Verification: review covers a11y, perf, offline, security. - Deprecations: migration note + runtime warning (1 release). - Docs: each feature merges with README/MDX. - Acceptance criteria: login flows, community publishing, subscriptions, integrations. - Tasks: Spec Kit generates frontend, backend/API, tests, GDPR/security, docs tasks per feature."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
An education provider (Teacher) wants a unified platform (Skolapp) to create, manage, and share interactive learning content and quizzes with students across devices (mobile, tablets, desktops) while ensuring privacy, accessibility, and optional AI assistance without locking critical flows behind AI reliance.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a Teacher with authenticated access and required role, **When** they create a new quiz from a template, **Then** the quiz is saved and becomes accessible to enrolled/pseudonymous Students according to assigned visibility rules.
2. **Given** a Student accessing the app on a mobile browser offline after prior sync, **When** they open the quiz list, **Then** they see last-synced quizzes with a timestamp and any attempted submissions queue locally for later upload.
3. **Given** a Teacher enabling optional AI assistance while drafting a question, **When** AI suggestions are requested, **Then** suggestions appear labeled as AI-generated and the Teacher may accept, edit, or discard without blocking manual entry.
4. **Given** a Student with limited accessibility needs (keyboard-only), **When** navigating interactive quiz elements, **Then** all focusable elements follow logical order and provide visible focus states.
5. **Given** a payment-eligible Teacher wanting premium analytics, **When** they initiate a subscription on web, **Then** payment is processed via Stripe and subscription status reflects in their account without exposing raw payment data.
6. **Given** the system under GDPR obligations, **When** a Teacher requests data export, **Then** the platform initiates a queued export with anonymization of Student pseudonymous identifiers preserved but not deanonymized.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a network request times out during quiz submission? → Queue submission locally and display retry notice.
- How does system handle AI provider downtime? → Display non-blocking notice and allow manual authoring (no hard fail of feature).
- Offline with no prior cache? → Show friendly empty offline state + prompt to connect.
- Payment cancellation mid-checkout? → Return to subscription page with status unchanged and guidance to retry.
- Student attempts to access restricted Teacher-only analytics? → Deny with role-based message; log security event.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST allow Teachers to authenticate with multi-factor or federated identity if configured (OIDC/SAML).  
- **FR-002**: System MUST allow Students to join using a pseudonymous identifier provided by a Teacher (e.g., class code).  
- **FR-003**: System MUST enable Teachers to create, edit, publish, and archive quizzes and learning templates.  
- **FR-004**: System MUST provide role-based access control (Teacher vs Student) enforcing permissions on content creation, sharing, analytics access, and moderation actions.  
- **FR-005**: System MUST cache essential content (quiz list, active quiz, static assets) for offline read access and queued write operations.  
- **FR-006**: System MUST expose an optional AI-assisted suggestion flow for quiz/question authoring without making AI use mandatory.  
- **FR-007**: System MUST label AI-generated suggestions clearly to end users (Teachers).  
- **FR-008**: System MUST enable Teachers to share select content (quizzes/templates) to a community library with license metadata and moderation status.  
- **FR-009**: System MUST support subscription purchase and renewal for premium Teacher features (analytics) via web payment processor.  
- **FR-010**: System MUST reflect premium entitlement immediately after payment confirmation (or with clear pending state).  
- **FR-011**: System MUST log security-relevant events (role escalation attempts, failed auth) without storing raw PII beyond minimal required identifiers.  
- **FR-012**: System MUST allow Teachers to request export of their contributed content and account-related metadata in a portable format.
